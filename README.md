An implementation of probabilistic methods for detecting de novo mutations from nuclear family genome data.

There are currently two versions of the trio model. Master is the trio model that uses customized Dirichlet-multinomial approximations. The infinite sites model branch is the trio model that uses simpler multinomial approximations and an infinite sites model. The simulation program is based on the trio model that uses the Dirichlet-multinomial (master).

#Required libraries

This project uses C++11, Eigen, GNU Scientific Library, BamTools, and Boost. It compiles using Clang and CMake, configured specifically for use with herschel (Cartwright lab). You may need to modify ```CMakeLists.txt``` to make this project compile for your system.

Download [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) and put the source code in the project directory.

Download [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

Download [BamTools](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools). Keep a local copy of the ```utils``` folder in the project directory as the file ```utils/bamtools_pileup_engine.h``` is required.

Download [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download/). Be sure to include and build the unit test framework.

#Compilation

```mkdir build``` makes a build directory.

```cd build``` navigates to the new build directory.

```cmake ..``` reads ```CMakeLists.txt``` and makes the build files. ```FindGSL.cmake``` and ```FindBamTools.cmake``` are provided in the ```Modules``` folder.

```make``` builds the CMake files.

To execute a file, use ```./<filename>```.

#Testing

Navigate to the build directory you created earlier to compile the project and type ```make test``` to run all Boost tests in the test folder. If there are any changes to ```CMakeLists.txt```, the command ```cmake ..``` must precede ```make test``` in order to update.

Individual tests can be executed using ```./<filename>```.
